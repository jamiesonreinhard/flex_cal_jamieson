Welcome to InfusionClickSoftFunnel, LLC.! It’s your first day as a new developer on the team, and your first task is to finish an already in-progress contact manager project. The developer who was working on it just left a month early for 3 months of maternity leave, so you’ve been hired to finish it. The Product team needs this project done by the end of the day to allow Sales to prepare for a demo to a lucrative new prospect they are presenting to next week. 

With much excitement and exhilaration to show your coding prowess, you open the link to the GitHub repo, fork it, and set up the app on your local machine.

Your dev manager likes frequent commits, so you plan to commit each step of the product spec individually and clearly label each commit with the corresponding step.

Feel free to include libraries that you may find useful, like jQuery.

When you open the product spec, you see the following:

1. Currently the calendar defaults to 6 weeks.  Make it smarter to show 5 or 4 weeks, whatever the max is need to show the whole month.

2. Add a color picker to the footer of the application to allow the end user to change their basic color theme.  Apply the color upon selecting a new color.

3. Currently we have data for hourly time slots, Add the ability to enter in daily entries.

4. Change the number of rows from an input to a slider and re-label it as Weeks instead of Rows

5. Move the number of weeks and color picker into a modal launched from a new gear icon located somewhere of your choice on the application, but remove the footer all together.

6. Change the 24 hour inputs to a range only of 7am to 7pm

7. Change Up Down buttons to be << Month, << Week, Today, Week >>, Month >>

8. BONUS: Allow the end user to enter a iCal feed via the settings modal and apply it to the calendar.

9. BONUS: Add any tests you see fit
